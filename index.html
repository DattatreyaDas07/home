		<h3>Hello Nerds!</h3>
		<p>I am Dattatreya Das, a 20 year old student who have just received his bachelor's degree in physics and soon going to do his master's.
		<br><br>I have been deeply interested in physics since I was in high school. I used to watch a lot of sci-comm videos and documentaries related to physics and math. I like physics because of the broad range of interesting stuff it encapsulates. From elementary particles to black holes, different theories and experiments, from simple statements to a wide variety of maths.
		<br><br>I don't get discouraged by complicated physics and maths. I believe if I put enough effort and an optimistic attitude, go through different study materials like books, notes, videos, and simulators, and give it proper time, I will be able to understand it. I also don't like to focus on memorizing laws and formulas while reading them. I like to enjoy the content of the book without focusing on the fear of forgetting it. If I forget, I can re-read the book again to recall the information. And by learning something many times from different sources, you simply get a good grasp of it so you won't forget it for a really, really long time.
		<br><br>Everything that exists has certain properties and behaviours which can be described, whether it follows human intuition or not. I want to know these descriptions and contribute by doing research and teaching others with similar interests to know a little bit more.</p>
